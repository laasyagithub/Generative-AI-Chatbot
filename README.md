# Generative-AI-Chatbot
This code creates an interactive webpage showcasing a Generative AI Project. 
 It includes the following features:

Dynamic Description Updates:
Users can click on topic icons (e.g., Google Colab, Gradio, OpenAI) to display detailed descriptions in a designated section.

Social Media Sharing:
Buttons for Twitter, LinkedIn, and WhatsApp allow users to share the project link with pre-filled text using respective APIs.

Responsive and Aesthetic Design:
A modern, minimalistic layout styled with CSS features a dark theme and responsive flexbox alignment.

JavaScript-Driven Interactivity:
JavaScript manages event listeners for clicks, dynamic content updates, and the opening of social media sharing links.

This project demonstrates a blend of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing an example of interactive, visually appealing web development.
